    The program calculates how long it takes for a person to become a millionaire by investing a certain amount every month.
    Furthermore, it gives her the option to say how long she would maintain this monthly investment rhythm and what her results would be.
    By default, a Brazil CDB (Bank Deposit Certificate) income tax (IR) discount is considered:
        Up to 180 n_day_counters: 22.5%
        From 181 to 360 n_day_counters: 20%
        From 361 to 720 n_day_counters: 17.5%
        More than 721 n_day_counters: 15%
    Note: IR is only applied to profit.
    IOF is disregarded because time periods tend to be long.
    It is assumed that there is no administration fee.
    Daily liquidity income is considered to occur only on business n_day_counters (weekends are not considered).
